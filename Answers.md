1. If you had to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

Semantics is the study of language meaning. For language this is the words we use to communicate, and for HTML it's the tags we use to mark a document. For example, a <p> tag indicates a paragraph. This tag is semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are and browsers know how to display them.

2. Describe some differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.

With display: inline-block , the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not. Compared to display: block , the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.

4. While using flexbox, what axis are you using when you use the property: ```align-items: center```?
